# UI
- instead of using Container, prefer more specific widgets like SizedBox, Padding, ColoredBox, etc
- when you need to add widgets, add the fewer widgets possible

# dart code
- avoid mutating instances
- instead of using List, use IList from 'package:fast_immutable_collections/fast_immutable_collections.dart'
- empty ILists are created using 'IList()'

## dart naming conventions
- put the most descriptive noun last
- use wildcards for unused callback parameters
- sort imports alphabetically
