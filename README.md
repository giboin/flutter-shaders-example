This is a simple example of how to use shaders in Flutter.

## What's inside?

- A **tutorial** part to learn how to use shaders in Flutter.
  Each page has a different shader effect, more and more complex.

- A **showcase** part, with some more complex or useful shader effects that I've found around the web. Most ideas come from [fluttershaders](https://fluttershaders.com/)

The "glow stuff" part comes from renancaraujo's [Glow stuff with flutter](https://github.com/renancaraujo/glow_stuff_with_flutter)

The "halo" screen is adapted from [magician0809's shader](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3tBGRm)
